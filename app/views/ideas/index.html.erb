<h1>Welcome to GroupEats</h1>
<h2>Recreating the Food Delivery World<h2>
<font size="-1"> Food delivery services were created for customers looking for convenience, whether that’s saving time with door-to-door delivery or just not wanting to leave your home after a long day of work. The question is, when does the markup on that service outpace the value provided? When you use a delivery app, you’re paying multiple parties. That includes not just the restaurant but also the app company and delivery drivers. According to The New York Times, markups can range from 25% to a staggering 91% - and that doesn’t even include tips. Furthermore, if you’re looking to order just one item for yourself it’s common for a small order fee to be added on. In this scenario customers either pay that additional fee or increase their order size to avoid it.
        <br></br>
         <p>At GroupEats, we have first-hand experience on how these fees add up. We believe delivery drivers should be paid fairly for their services and customers should only have to pay the costs that are true to the value they are receiving. As per Business Wire, the delivery service industry is forecasted to increase 11.5% by 2023. We envision capturing part of that market share by creating a group delivery service, combining the digital social world with on demand food delivery. GroupEats will allow you to jump in on a group order, significantly minimizing the additional fees that current delivery services add in and creating a much more efficient and profitable structure for drivers. See below to meet our team members and our backgrounds. </small></font>
